# RS3 Arch Tome Calculator

This is a calculator that will tell you the chance you have to get a tome from a arch spot with a specific level.

This is basically useless as it takes probably just as long to use this as it would to type the formula into a calculator, and this should at least produce
the same results as windows calculator would if you had done so.

On the bright side, I learned how to use a BigDecimal and round it so that was cool.
